# HomeServer APIs
I recently implementeda Flask Webserver for my home and implemented APIs to make it more efficient!
This repository contains a collection of APIs i am creating right now to enhance the functionality of my web home server. 
These APIs are designed to make your home server more efficient, accessible, and versatile.
